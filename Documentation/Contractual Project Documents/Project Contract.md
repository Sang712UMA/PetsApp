## Short description of the project
We want to create an app/a wep for animals. This app/wep include various functions which will help the pets and their owners.
#### Problem that you aim to solve
* Pets dying on streets
* People who help pets without enough resources
* Overflowing of Shelters
* Lost pets
* Neglected pets when their owners can't take care of them
* Pet owners, which will go for holidays, searching for a person to take care of their pets for a couple of days
* Pets that their owners don't live with anymore, which need a family
#### Proposed solution
* Developing a social app/web to share resources and help pets and owners
#### Collaborative aspects of the chosen approach
* People can upload an animal's information they have found on a street
   - So that other people who have interests can take care of them
   - Or that the shelter can rescue them

* People can help owners, taking care of their pets during holidays or when they can't
* Contributors will be rewarded with resources which will help them with taking care of animals
