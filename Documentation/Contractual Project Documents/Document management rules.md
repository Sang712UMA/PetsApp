# Document management rules

## 1. Consistent Folder Structure

The document management requires structure. We have to take time to figure out the rank of importance of our documents, and the roles, limitations, and responsibilities attached to them.

## 2. Consistent Document Names

We have to make sure the core differentiators are accounted for in a documentâ€™s metadata (either automatically or manually). The document management requires indexing metadata for organization, and subsequently rapid retrieval.

## 3. Automate ASAP

Get a pilot system working quickly to help people adjust and also provide input for improvement.

## 4. Save in One Spot and One Spot Only

Once we apply a DMS to our organization, the entire workforce operates as one, fluid operating system. No one person can simply edit and save a document as they please anymore, because someone else might need to do something completely different to the same file.
