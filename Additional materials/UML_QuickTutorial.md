## What is UML?
 
 The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system.
 
 UML is not a programming language but tools can be used to generate code in various languages using UML diagrams. UML has a direct relation with object oriented analysis and design. After some standardization, UML has become an OMG standard.
 
 To model the static aspects of a software system, UML provides the following diagrams:
* Class diagram -> [Class diagram tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UI6lqHOVHic)
* Object diagram -> [From class diagram to object diagram tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdyddBIfPvE)
* Component diagram -> [Component diagram tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQUGFFN4M90)
* Deployment diagram -> [Example of a deployment diagram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drD-WvF8oYA)
 
 ## Why UML?
 
 Because UML:
* Permits you to specify the structure or behavior of a system.
* Helps you visualize a system.
* Provides template that guides you in constructing a system.
* Helps to understand complex system part by part.
* Document the decisions that you have made.
