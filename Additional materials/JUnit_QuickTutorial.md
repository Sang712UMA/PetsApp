## What is JUnit?

JUnit is an open source **framework** designed for the purpose of **writing and running tests** in the Java programming language.
JUnit has a graphical user interface (GUI), making it possible to write and test source code quickly and easily. 
JUnit allows the developer to incrementally build test suites to measure progress and detect unintended side effects. 
Tests can be run continuously. Results are provided immediately.
